Time And Space Complexity

----- Time Complexity

Asymptotic Analysis -> No. Of OPerations/Instructions as a function of inputs

 ****Types Of Time Complexity Analysis and their Notations: ***
 
 - Worst case Time Complexity
	Big O O(n)
	
 - Best Case Time Complexity
	Big Omega Ω(1)
	
 - Average Case Time Complexity
	Big Theta Φ(n)





---------- Space Complexity ----------

- Extra memory/Space used by an algorithm proprtional to size

Notations are same as Time Complexity.
